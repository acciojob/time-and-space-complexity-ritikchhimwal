	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. A more efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity, making it faster for larger inputs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm that requires O(n) space needs memory proportional to the size of the input.
